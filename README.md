# 3D Prosthetics Reconstruction
Rather than trying to make 3d reconstrution techniques work, this project aims to see if computer vision methods can be used to obtain relevant measurements from a human residual body part. These measurements would then be used to geenerate a 3D digital twin which would eventually be manipulated with minor changes in order to suit a patient. </br>

## NOTES
1. This project uses deep learning as image processing techniques are too simple to be effective. 
2. It is hard to tell if this method will work but we will see as time goes.
